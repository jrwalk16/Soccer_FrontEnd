### Process

I wanted to create a front end application that worked with my soccer statistics backend. My inspiration was a site called basketball reference which I linked below. So I wanted to create a very basic beginning workings and be able to add/update features as my knowledge base expands.

### Things to add in the future

1. Add a form to another page that allows an authenticated user to add items to the database.
2. Allow a user to search by teams and shows history of players for that team.
3. Allow a user to view a players statistics broken down by all teams they played for.


### Issues Encountered

1. A big hurdle I had was getting my ngIf/ngFor logic correct so that the page would display the correct information. For a long time it would return the array of objects inside the database but not look for the specific player. The link below was a big help if figuring out my issue.

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to retrieve a players statistics.
* As a user, I want to be able to add a new player/team to the database.
